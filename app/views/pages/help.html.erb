<a name="1">&nbsp;</a><h3>I just want to see</h3>

<p>Just browse on over to the <%= link_to "menu", concept_path(1) %> and look at the offerings.</p>

<a name="2">&nbsp;</a><h3>I want to rate stuff</h3>

<p><%= link_to "Sign up", signup_path %> and then browse on over to the menu, and rate anything you want.</p>

<a name="3">&nbsp;</a><h3>I want to define stuff</h3>

<p>For that you will need to <%= link_to "create an account", signup_path %> (free, fast and simple) and then
you will be able to define what you value in any and all the items the Queen's Ferry has to offer. 
Do you think the amount of salt is important? Do you think the crispiness is important?
Great! You can do that! All you have to do is
define your very own <i>value dimensions</i> which is fast and easy.</p>


<a name="4">&nbsp;</a><h3>What are those little icons everywhere?</h3>

<p>The little icons are there to help you. The <%= image_tag "tooltip.gif" %> icon gives you information to
help you use the site better. Roll the mouse over and you'll see the information. The <%= image_tag "belief_set.gif" %>
icon allows you to set what you believe is the ideal value for a dimension. You can tell if you have not set a
belief for a value dimension if the icon is red (<%= image_tag "belief_not_set.gif" %>). You have to be registered and signed in to use that though.
And the <%= image_tag "star.png" %> icon tells you if a dimension is a factual one.</p>

<a name="5">&nbsp;</a><h3>What is a factual dimension?</h3>

<p>A factual value dimension is one that cannot be rated because it is a fact. For example the number of calaries in the food
is not ver debatable. Factual dimensions cannot be edited unless you have special permissions on the site.
